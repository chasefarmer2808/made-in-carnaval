  "rioContent1": "This is the place where everything started. It was during carnaval 2020, holding a beer and dancing samba that we saw each other for the first time.  As our lives are built by the many connections we have, our meeting was possible thanks to two special friends: Mayara and Farshid.",
  "rioContent2": "Mayara is Nicole's friend from Rio, and Farshid is one of Chase's best friends in Baltimore.  Both are friends of one Brazilian couple that used to be Farshid's neighbor.  This couple connected Chase and Farshid to Mayara on their vacation in Rio, and Mayara invited them to a Samba concert.  This is where the bride and groom met and their lives changed forever.  The story seems crazy, right?  You'll hear more at the celebration 😉.",
