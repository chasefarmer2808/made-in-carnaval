          Beach area. Othon Palace is located right on the beach, while Savoy
          Othon is a couple blocks up. Both hotels offer free breakfast, wifi, a
          gym and a kids play area. However,{" "}

        <h3>Other Areas To Stay</h3>
        <p>
          Feel free to find accomodations other than the above hotels. However,
          we recommend staying in the following tourist neighborhoods in Zona
          Sul (South Zone), as they are safe and offer many things to do:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Copacabana/Leme (Great beach on the ocrean)</li>
          <li>
            Ipanema/Leblon (Next to Copacabana but a little more expensive;
            great beach on the ocean)
          </li>
          <li>
            Flamengo/Botafogo (Close to Copacabana and a little less expensive;
            beach on the bay where you do not swim).
          </li>

        <h3>Traveling from the USA</h3>
        <p>
          Rio has two major airports: Galeao (GIG) and Santos Dumont (SDU). Fun
          fact: Most of the world believes that Santos Dumont was the first
          person to invent the airplane, not the Wright brothers. Most major
          airline companies have direct flights to Galeao from many cities in
          the US, such as Miami, Orlando, New York, Huston, etc. We like to use{" "}

        <h3>Local Currency</h3>
        <p>
          It is best to use a travel credit card when you can, but it is also
          important to have some cash on hand. The currency in Brazil is the
          Real. Today, one US dollar is about 5 Reais (half a liter of beer in
          Rio). You can change your US cash either in the Rio airport or one of
          the many local currency exchange buisinesses. You can usually find a
          better rate ourside the airport.{" "}

        <h3>Do I Need to Rent a Car?</h3>
        <p>
          NO! GOD NO! PLEASE!!!! Traffic and parking are not great in Rio, so we
          do not recommend renting a car. Rio has a good public transportation
          service with buses and metro. Uber is also extremely available and
          easy to use.

            Rio has so many things to do that it is impossible to list
            everything. Depending on your travel style, you can spend the day on
            the beach, bike through the city, hike, climb, party all night,
            visit museums, etc. Ask us if you have any questions, and do not be
            afraid to follow Rio&apos;s energy.

        <h3>Rent a Bike!</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Bike Itau</a> is a public rental bike service. There are many
          stations around the city for a quick and cheap way to get around. We
          recommend riding along the beach on the Pramanade.

        <h3>Food and Drink ðŸ¤¤</h3>
        <p>
          Enjoy the food! Try things that you never had before. Such as:
          feijoada, coxinha, dadinho de tapioca, bolinho de bacalhau, pastel,
          picadinho, and much more. At the beach, you need to have a mate and
          biscoito globo. It is the favorite combination for cariocas. Wash it
          all down with a caipirinha, cerveja, or agua de coco!!!
